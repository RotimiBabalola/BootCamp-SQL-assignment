# BootCamp-SQL-assignment

This is the SQL assignment for the Andela Bootcamp. This file creates a database for a pet store that sells dogs. 
In this database we track information about people who buy dogs and the dogs that are sold. 
Therefore, we have two tables - one for users and another for the dogs. Finally, we insert some data into both tables.
